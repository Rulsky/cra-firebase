# cra-firebase

This is a helper library which helps to implement server-side rendering (SSR) of project started with help of [create-react-app (CRA)](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) in [google's firebase (FBS)](https://firebase.google.com/)

# The idea
The capabilities which provide both create-react-app and firebase speeds up development of a product and removes lots of headaches, but they could do even more together.

'Firebase cloud functions' allows to implement server-side rendering, but our code needs to be prepared for the server beforehand.
Two major requirements are:
  - compatible with node v6.11.5
  - jsx should be transpiled into plain js

Also, we need to share some code between server and client. And it is good to write in one style (i.e. in es6/7).

So, in order to ease achievement of all these goals you can use this tool.
Basically, this utility uses babel with necessary presets to transpile server and shared code into compatible with node 6.

It also can provide you with initial source code to see how it work.

# How to use

## New project

1. Init project with help of [create-react-app (CRA)](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
2. Install [firebase-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase-tools) as a npm devDependency or a global module - this is up to your personal taste:
   `yarn add -D firebase-tools` or `npm i -D firebase-tools` or `npm i -G firebase-tools`
3. Init project with firebase `yarn firebase init` or `$(npm bin)/firebase init` or `firebase init`
4. During initialization check `functions` and `hosting` options. Optionally, also check `firestore` - example code provides a graphql on top of firestore.
5. As a hosting dir specify `build`
6. Add [cra-firebase](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cra-firebase) (e.g. this utility) as a devDependency: `yarn add -D cra-firebase` or `npm i -D cra-firebase`
7. Run `yarn cra-firebase init -y` or `$(npm bin)/cra-firebase init -y`

## Existing projects
1. Add [cra-firebase]() (e.g. this utility) as a devDependency: `yarn add -D cra-firebase` or `npm i -D cra-firebase`
2. Update your `package.json` `scripts` by either:
  - A) Add command into `package.json` `scripts` which will execute this line `cra-firebase build`
  - B) run `yarn cra-firebase init` to get step-by-step process of updating your project

# Commands 
- `init` - initialize project.
- `build` - builds ypu project.
- `start` - watches your src files and transforms them into node 6 compatible code.
- `version` - outputs current version of this utility.


## Description of the commands

## What happens when you run the `init -y` command:
  1. Modifies your project's `package.json` file and replaces CRA's `build` script with own. Don't worry: during the running of cra-firebase build, it also runs CRA build scripts.
  2. Deals with rewrite rules in your `firebase.json`:
    - If during firebase initialization process you chosed SPA option this script replaces default rewrite rule which point to `index.html` to point to a function `app`.
    - If no appropriate rule was found it adds one.
    - If a correct rule already present (i.e. points to app function) - just skips this step.
    - Also, if you already defined your own rule for '\*\*' route - it will respect it and will skip this step.
  3. Appends to your `.gitignore` file list of dirs and files which are dynamically generated by cra-firebase. This step respects your firebase config. **Plese note**, that this step doesn't check if ignores are already present in your `.gitignore`.
  4. Inserts seed code into your project.

**Or You can run `init` without `-y` flag - in this case you'll be asked about each step.**

## What happens when you run the `build` command
  1. Sets `BABEL_ENV` to production - a requirement of the react-app babel preset. It also saves a previous value and restores it in the end.
  2. Deletes CRA `build` directory, and files which cra-firebase generates.
  3. Runs CRA 'build' script.
  4. Transpiles all code that should go into firebase functions.
  5. Copies `index.html` content into `markup.js`.
  6. Deletes `build/index.html`. This is crucial to make SSR to work. Otherwise, firebase will ignore your rewrite rule.
  7. Copies dependencies from your root package.json into functions's
  8. runs `npm i` inside functions dir
  9. Sets `BABEL_ENV` to the original value.

# Serving firebase cloud functions locally
0. as of 08 MAR 2018 use filrebase-tools@3.17.4 (the 3.17.5 is broken).
1. setup your admin credentials following a [guide from functions docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/local-emulator)
2. put a file with your service admin key into your project's `functions` dir
3. run one of:

`yarn build`
`yarn firebase deploy`
`yarn firebase serve --only functions,hosting`

or 

`npm run build`
`$(npm bin)/firebase deploy`
`$(npm bin)/firebase serve --only functions,hosting`

or if you used default init params you will have npm script command `build` and `fbs:start` - issue it and you good to go.

Please keep in mind that firebase hosting will serve static files from your build directory, so upon client hydration you'll finish with old version of your app.

In feature I hope to add a functionality to serve fresh version of static files. I suspect that this requires to run a webpack with CRA build config in parallel with local firebase emulation.

# About directories and files structure:

CRA provides to us a slightly rigid structure of our code: all source code should be in `src` dir. And there is no way to tell CRA to handle other structure.
That's why I suggest supporting this idea further in a manner of putting structure into a structure like this:
```bash
├── src/
│   ├── client/
│   │   └── clientOnly.jsx
│   │
│   ├── shared/
│   │   └── components/
│   │       └── app.jsx
│   │
│   ├── server/
│   │   └── serverOnly.js
│   │
│   ├── index.js
│   └── server.index.js
│
```

This utility respects a custom name of firebase's dir structure looks into your `firebase.json` for a name of your functions dir. Here a quote from [FBS docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started):

> By default, the Firebase CLI looks in the functions/ folder for the source code. You can specify another folder by adding the following lines in `firebase.json`:

```JSON
"functions": {
  "source": "another-folder"
}
```

So, all transpiled code from src will be written into proper functions dir.
`server.index.js` will be transpiled and output into `index.js` under functions dir.

Another vital point to implement SSR is to provide to your server a code with initial markup.
Since CRA generates bundles with dynamic names we need to know their names to serve correct HTML with SSR.
So, as a result of a build process, you will have a `markup.js` file in your functions dir. This is a file which exports a single function as a default export. This function accepts single argument which is expected to be a result of a `react-dom/server.renderToString` call.

Basically, in your `server.index.js` you can write next:
```javascript
import { https } from 'firebase-functions'
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server'
import React from 'react'
import markup from './markup'
import App from './shared/components/App'

const app = https.onRequest((req, res) => {
  const apphtml = renderToString(<App />)
  res.status(200).send(markup(apphtml))
})

export { app }
```
*As I understand from firebase documentation you need a named export in your `functions/index.js` even if you exporting only one function. This makes sense to me because you can do more than just SSR.
By the way: you can use this tool to write cloud functions code using modern ES syntax.*

### ⚠️ **WARNING**: you must destrucure `firebase-functions` import because there is no default export ([read more here](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-functions/issues/33))


# About `markup.js`
Because CRA setup of webpack genarates each time assets with dynamic names we need to know those names. And the only availiable approach is to read  `build/index.html` and transform it into function which will accapt additional content and return whole markup as a string. Finally, we can send this string to a user.

`markup.js` exports a single function as a default export.

This function has 3 arguments:
1. content - required. expects a result of renderToString or similar function, 
2. scriptsGlabals - optional. Expects a object, which transformed into additional <scripts> in the bottom of a html. 
keys becomes names for global variables with corresponding values.
example:
```javascript
{
  'window.__APOLLO_STATE__': 'yourstate',
  otherKey: 'bla-bla-bla',
}
```
transforms into:
```html
<script charset="UTF-8">
  window.__APOLLO_STATE__="yourstate";
  otherKey="bla-bla-bla";
</script>
```
3. headNodes - optional. Expects a string of html nodes(tags) which will be injected into the markup. For example, you can inject styles or additional meta. Please note, that headNodes will be injected right before `</head>` closing tag. In another words: it will be the last in the head.

Usage example:
```javascript
// in server.index.js
import { https } from 'firebase-functions'
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server'
import React from 'react'
import markup from './markup'
import App from './shared/components/App'

const app = https.onRequest((req, res) => {
  const apphtml = renderToString(<App />)
  const globalVars = {
    myGlobalVar: 'globalVarValue'
  }
  const injectIntoHead = '<meta charset="utf-8">'
  const finalMarkup = markup(apphtml, globalVars, injectIntoHead)
  res.status(200).send(finalMarkup)
})

export { app }
```

# Handling more filetypes and/or syntaxes

## Adding more babel presets and plugins
By default, cra-firebase uses next presets:
  - env - with targeting node: '6.11.1',
  - react-app - same as CRA
  - flow

You can specify more babel presets and plugins in order to deal with new file formats or for some additional features.
You can do it via CLI commands, `.babelrc` file at the root of your project, or in `package.json` in `babel` field.

CLI commands are:
  - presets: `--presets=preset-name,other-preset`
  - plugins: `--plugins=plugin-name,other-plugin,more-one-plugin,list-may-continue`

<!-- The precedence is **(from most important to less)** cli -> `.babelrc` -> `package.json` -> default config.
So, please, keep in mind that if you specify env preset the default one will be overwritten. -->

At the current state, this utility doesn't handle declaration of presets/plugins with options, because it doesn't dedupe such declarations.
But simple declarations (without options) works.
```javascript
"presets": [
  ["env", {"targets": { "node": 8}}] // will not be deduped
  "react" // will be deduped
]
```

*Please note that this utility is interested in plugins and presets sections configuration of babel, other parts are ignored. It does **NOT** look into any env option, only default one.*

## Adding more filetypes into filtering
you can specify in `package.json` or in `.crafirebaserc.json` or via CLI command option more filetypes which you want to add/exclude to a process of babel transformation.

In configuration files values must be arrays of strings.

An example of `package.json`:
```JSON
"crafirebase": {
  "exclude": ["tmp.ts", "tmp.js"],
  "include": [".ts", ".filetypeofyourtaste"]
}
```

An example of `.crafirebaserc.json`:
```JSON
"exclude": ["tmp.ts", "tmp.js"],
"include": [".ts", ".filetypeofyourtaste"]
```

The examples of CLI commands:
  - exclude: `--exclude=.sh,.tmp`
  - include: `--include=.txt,.ts`


# Seed code
I've build some basic seed code which you can use as a starter for your project.

It has graphQL with help of apollo, styled-components and SSR.

It requires Firestore to be enabled. Don't worry - I've made seed code to be clever enough to detect if Firestore is enabled and it will notify you. And it will provide you with an a option to fill your Firestore with example data.

After Firestore was populated I recommend you to delete a file `src/server/utils/fillDb.js` and line 18 in `src/server.index.js`. It is `expressApp.get('/api/seeddb', fillDb)`.


# Known problems
## flow types and some npm packages
add this into your `.flowconfig` `[ignore]` section
```
.*node_modules/protobufjs/src/bower.json.*
.*node_modules/react-apollo/react-apollo.umd.js.flow.*
```

## Development process
Problem of serving firebase locally and development: right now I can't figure how to toss CRA dev tools into firebase serve functionality. So right now you have a localhost:3000 for front-only and localhost:5000 for back-end only.

## Assets
Assets like SVG and css aren't fit well within server. Because node expects plain javascript.

You can add additional babel transformers and file designated to be transformed (instructions below). But bear in mind that during transformation import statements must be altered to address proper filenames. i.e. if in your src
```javascript
import icon from 'icon.svg'
```
In your output file should be something like this
```javascript
const icon = require('icon')
```

### Alternative solutions:
**for SVG**: convert SVG into plain react components with any tool. For example [SVGR](https://github.com/smooth-code/svgr).

And for styles use something more suitable into SSR (like styled-components).

# Configuration
This utility allowed to be configured via `.crafirebaserc.json` or a `crafirebase` section in root's `package.json`

What could be configured:

| config field  | default value           | description                               |
| :------------ | :--------------         | ----------------------------------------- |
| index         | server.index.js         | filename of source of server's index file |
| include       | ['.js', '.jsx', '.svg'] | file extensions which should be transformed with help of babel and moved into functions. Default values are NOT overwritten, which means they will be merged   |
| exclude       | ['spec.js', 'test.js']  | file extensions which should be excluded from copy/transform. Default values are NOT overwritten, which means they will be merged                           |
|               |                         |                                           |
